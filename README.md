By default, the 6x6 grid is used. You can click on any empty square to place a marker. The grid will then be updated by blocking out invalid squares.

To try to solve the grid from any position, click the "Solve!" button. If no solution exists from the starting position, the closest solution will be shown.

You can try other grid sizes, but larger sizes may freeze your browser.
